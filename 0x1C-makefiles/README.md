## Introduction

Makefiles are powerful build automation tools that enable developers to define and execute a series of commands to build and manage their projects. The 0x1C-makefiles repository provides a set of pre-configured makefiles that can be used as a starting point for different types of projects.

The makefiles included here are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to modify them to suit their specific needs. They provide a standardized structure for organizing source code files, handling dependencies, and managing the build process.

## Installation

To use the makefiles provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the cloned directory:


That's it! You now have the makefiles ready to be used in your projects.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in the repository represents a different type of project (e.g., C, C++, Python). Within each subdirectory, you will find a makefile along with the necessary source code files.

To use the makefile for your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the relevant makefile into your project directory.

2. Open the makefile using a text editor and review the configuration variables at the beginning of the file. Modify these variables as needed to match your project's structure and requirements.

3. In your project directory, run the `make` command to execute the makefile and build your project:


This will invoke the necessary compilation and linking commands specified in the makefile and generate the desired output (e.g., executable, library).

Additional makefile targets and rules may be available depending on the specific makefile. Check the comments and documentation within each makefile for more information.
